# 🏬 Enterprise Retail Network Design & Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **secure, scalable, and highly available enterprise retail network**.  
It simulates a real-world retail company with **multiple branches**, **central headquarters**, and **core IT services** such as DHCP, DNS, FTP, Email, and Internet access.

The lab is designed for **learning, testing, and troubleshooting enterprise networking concepts** using practical scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design a **hierarchical enterprise network** (Core, Distribution, Access)
- Implement **VLANs** to separate departments
- Configure **dynamic routing** for inter-branch communication
- Provide **centralized network services**
- Secure the network using **ACLs and firewall concepts**
- Enable **NAT/PAT** for Internet access
- Practice **real-world troubleshooting**

---

## 🏢 Network Environment
The retail company consists of:

- **Headquarters (HQ)**
- **Branch Stores**
- **Data Center**
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**

Each branch supports:
- Point of Sale (POS)
- Inventory systems
- Staff PCs
- Guest Wi-Fi (isolated)

---

## 🧱 Network Architecture
### Layers
- **Core Layer** – High-speed routing & redundancy
- **Distribution Layer** – Policy enforcement and inter-VLAN routing
- **Access Layer** – End-user connectivity

### VLAN Design
| VLAN ID | Department        |
|-------|-------------------|
| 10    | Management        |
| 20    | Sales / POS       |
| 30    | Inventory         |
| 40    | IT / Admin        |
| 50    | Guest Wi-Fi       |

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3
- Cisco Routers & Switches
- Static & Dynamic Routing (OSPF / EIGRP)
- VLANs & Trunking (802.1Q)
- DHCP & DHCP Relay
- DNS, FTP, Email Servers
- NAT & PAT
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Basic Firewall Concepts

---

## 🌐 IP Addressing Scheme
- Private IP addressing (RFC 1918)
- Separate subnet per VLAN
- Centralized DHCP server
- Static IPs for infrastructure devices

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation
- Standard & Extended ACLs
- VLAN isolation
- Guest network restricted from internal resources
- NAT overload for Internet access
- Management access secured (SSH)

---

## 🧪 Lab Scenarios
- Inter-VLAN communication issues
- DHCP failure troubleshooting
- DNS resolution problems
- Internet access failure (NAT/PAT)
- Branch-to-HQ connectivity issues
